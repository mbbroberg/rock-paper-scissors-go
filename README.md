I'm working on my Go skills. I started thanks to [this book](https://leanpub.com/golang-tdd/read#leanpub-auto-the-product-vision). If you want to chat about it, hit me up [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/mjbrender) or on [this Slack Channel](https://geekspeak.herokuapp.com/) (<< This takes a little while to load thanks to Heroku free tier).

Keep sharing :neckbeard:
